# Pix2Pix-
Using pix2pix GAN to do Image translation from MRI magnitude image to its corresponding phase Image

**Ongoing Project**

Some images from the dataset:-

**MRI Magnitude Image**

**MRI Phase Image**

**As a sanity check I first train the network on 1/10th of the dataset that I have, and for the sake of convinience I also resized the image to (256,256), and the results are the following**





**Remaining parts of the project is expected to be uploaded soon (by 21st October)**
