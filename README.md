# Pix2Pix-
Using pix2pix GAN to do Image translation from MRI magnitude image to its corresponding phase Image

**Ongoing Project**

Some images from the dataset:-

**MRI Magnitude Image**

**MRI Phase Image**

**Although I won't be resizing the images when training the final network (because some information may get lost), I resized the images here just to see how well the network is performing**





**Remaining parts of the project is expected to be uploaded soon (by 21st October)**
